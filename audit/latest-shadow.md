## Failed gates

## Reasons
- WALLET_CAPITAL_UNKNOWN: no wallet configured
- CAPITAL_GRID_EMPTY: no research capital levels (wallet unknown or deployable <= 0)
- eligibleActualCandidates=0
- CAPITAL_SELECTION: no eligible ACTUAL_WALLET regime (fail closed)
- VALIDATION_ONLY: no persistence-qualifying snapshot written (external ACCEPT pending)
- no candidates produced (no eligible pair data or no capital grid)
- QUALIFICATION_UNVERIFIED: haircut=0.6
- modelVersion=8 capital=0 (none) qualifyingSnapshots=0 span=0.0h (total snapshots=31, validationOnly excluded, hypothetical never qualifies)
- FAIL: need >= 3 qualifying snapshots (same modelVersion/configFingerprint/pair/fee/range/capitalUsd/capitalSource + wallet regime, all gates passing)
